    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Make a Website with HTML and CSS </h1>
    <img src="./Sarahs favorite animal.png " style="width: 100vw;">
    <p>By Sarah Griffioen

        Today, we're going to be making a website about your favorite animal. We're going to be using Mozilla Thimble,
        and we'll be writing our website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No prior experience with web design or HTML is
        required. Let's get started!</p>
    <h2>STEP 0: HTML BASICS</h2>
    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the language we will be using to put the information on our pages such as a
        title, paragraph, list, etc. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what we are going to be using to style our pages by
        doing things like changing the color, centering the content, etc. We will be looking at some already written CSS
        code, but we will mostly be writing code in HTML today.

        Before we begin coding our website, it is important that we learn the basis of all HTML: tags. There are four
        main things that you need to know about tags. </p>
    <ol class="back">
        <li>
            Every element has an opening and a closing tag
            __Heading__


            All tags have "<>" around them
                <>Heading<>
                        All closing tags begin with a "/" inside the "<>"
                            <>Heading</>
                            All closing tags match their opening tags
                            <h>Heading</h>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Each tag has a meaning associated with it. For instance, "h1" is the largest heading, "p" is a paragraph, and
        "ul" makes an unordered list (list with bullet points). You will learn more of these tags as we code our website
        today, and you can always look up more tag names at w3schools.com. When you are coding your website today, make
        sure that every element (title, heading, paragraph, list, etc.) has an opening and a closing tag that
        corresponds with it, otherwise your web page might not appear exactly how you want it to.
    </p>
    <h2>STEP 1: SETUP </h2>
    <p>
        In order for us to make our website, we will need to follow the steps below to set up a code editor.
    <ol>
        <li>
            Go to Mozilla Thimble.</li>
        <li>Click "Create an account" in the top right corner. </li>
        <li>Enter a username, email, and password. </li>
        <li> Click "Sign Up."</li>
        <li>Click "Create a new Project." </li>

    </ol>
    <p>You should now be able to see the code editor on the left and the preview of the website on the right as shown
        below. Mozilla Thimble gives us a very basic website to start from, and it includes two pages that are shown on
        the bar on the left. The first page is "index.html," which is always the home page, and "style.css," which is
        our style sheet.</p>
    <img src="./untitledimage.png " style="width: 100vw;">

    You should rename your project something about your favorite animal, so click on "Untitled Project" in the top left
    corner in the green bar, and type in a name like "Sarah's Favorite Animal." Then click "Save." After you've renamed
    your project, we need to do one more thing before we begin coding our website. Click on the gear icon ⚙ at the top
    of coding section and turn off "auto close tags" and "autocomplete code."

    As you are going along coding your website, you may encounter some of your code turning pink. If that happens that
    means that you have made a syntax error. A syntax error means that you typed something in wrong. For example, you
    could have typed out an opening tag but forgot to type the closing tag. Or maybe you typed the closing tag, but you
    forgot the forward slash at the beginning of it. Just keep your eyes out for pink text, and if you see any, try to
    find the error and fix it before going on. Now we're all ready to start coding!
    <h2>STEP 2: HOME PAGE</h2>
    Every website needs a home page, and it can also have other pages. We will be making two pages: a Home page and a
    Fun Facts page that will display random facts about your animal. We are going to start by making the home page.
    Remember that we said that "index.html" is always the home page, so that is the page we are going to be editing
    first. Make sure that "index.html" is highlighted in the left bar indicating that "index.html" is the page that is
    being shown.

    <h2>Title</h2>
    The first thing we should do is change the title of the Website, and as we said earlier, <h> is the tag that makes
        text big enough to be a title. Nicely enough, they already have an <h> tag with a title inside of it, so all we
            have to do is change that text. Pick a title that makes sense with your favorite animal. As you are typing,
            you should see the title changing on the right side of your screen where the website preview is located. If
            you don't see this change, click on the reload button ⟳ on the top of the website preview section, and your
            edit should appear.

            <img src="./index.png" style="width: 100vw;">

            After changing the title, we should change the text inside the <title> tag above. This tag holds the text
                that goes in the browser tab. We don't want it to say "Made with Thimble." We would rather have it say
                something more helpful, perhaps the same thing that you put for the title of your website.

                <title>Sarah's Favorite Animal</title>
                You won't see anything change, but the tab in your web browser will look like the tab shown below once
                you finish your website.


                <img src="./image-5.png" style="width: 100vw;">
                <h2>Paragraph</h2>
                The next thing we want to edit is the paragraph. The tag for a paragraph is <p>, and Thimble has already
                    made a paragraph. We don't want it to say "Make something amazing with the web!", so delete all of
                    the text in between the opening paragraph tag
                <p> and the closing paragraph tag </p>. Then write a paragraph that describes your favorite animal. Make
                sure that your paragraph is inside the opening and closing paragraph tags (<p>paragraph</p>).


                <img src="./image-6.png" style="width: 100vw;">
                <h2>Image</h2>
                By now, you have edited all you can of the template that Thimble gives you, so we are going to start
                adding elements of our own! We have a title and a description of our animal, but we don't know what this
                animal looks like yet. We're going to add an image of our animal before the paragraph, so add a line in
                between the title and the paragraph. Add the line of code below, and we will finish filling it in after
                that.


                Notice that there is no closing tag to the opening image tag, which violates our rule that every HTML
                element must have an opening and a closing tag. This just happens to be one of the few exceptions to
                that rule.

                The "img" tag stands for image, and the "src" attribute of this tag stands for source. The source of an
                image is where you got the image from, which is often in the form of a URL, or Uniform Resource Locator.
                We are going to insert the URL for the image in between the quotation marks to specify the source of the
                image.

                Now we need to find an image of our animal, so go Google Images and search for an image of your animal
                by typing the name of your animal or something similar. Once you have found an image you like, click on
                the image, and it should become larger. Right click on the image and select "Copy Image Address."

                <img src="./image-7.png" style="width: 100vw;">
                Copying the image address will copy the link that points to this image (the source of the image). Now go
                back to Thimble and paste the link in between the quotation marks inside the image tag. To paste on a
                Mac, type ⌘ Command+V, and for any other kind of machine, type Control+V.

                Your image should now appear on your screen, but if it does not, there is a good chance that that
                particular image will not be able to be embedded into a website. If your image does not appear, delete
                the link that you just pasted into the image tag, go back to Google Images, find a different image, copy
                that image's link address, and paste it into your image tag.


                <img src="./image-8.png" style="width: 100vw;">
                As you can see, your image might be way too big or way too small. Fortunately, we can change the size of
                the image to be whatever we would like! Before the closing angle bracket > of the image tag, add a space
                and the code below.

                width="200"
                The 200 refers to the width of the image in pixels. A pixel is a tiny dot of color on your computer, and
                many of those tiny dots together make up the picture and everything else that is displayed on your
                screen. You can change the number 200 to a different number of pixels until you find the width of the
                image that you would like.


                <img src="./image-9.png" style="width: 100vw;">
                <h2>Link</h2>
                Since we won't have time to write down all the information about our animal on our website, it would be
                a good idea to insert a link to another page that has much more information about our animal. Let's
                start by writing a sentence that will help the users of your website know where to go to find more
                information about your animal. Add a new line for this sentence after the paragraph you wrote that
                describes your animal. Then write the code below onto that new line, inserting the name of your animal
                in the blank.

                <p>If you want to learn more about the _______, check out <a href="">its Wikipedia page.</a></p>
                We made a new paragraph with the <p> tag, and then we nested another tag inside of the
                <p> tag. This tag is the "a" tag, which stands for anchor, but the more important thing to note is the
                    attribute inside of the "a" tag. The attribute "href" stands for hypertext reference, and just like
                    "src" with our image, this hypertext reference is going to refer the user to the link once they
                    click on the words inside the "a" tag. In other words, it will take them to that web page, so we
                    need to find a link to fill into the quotation marks after the "href."

                    Go to another tab on your web browser and search for "[your animal] Wikipedia." In most cases, the
                    Wikipedia page for your animal will be the first link that pops up. Click on that link, highlight
                    the URL on the top left part of the browser, and copy it. To copy on a Mac, type ⌘ Command+C, and
                    for any other kind of machine, type Control+C.


                    <img src="./image-10.png" style="width: 100vw;">
                    Then go back to Thimble and paste that URL in between the quotation marks in the "a" tag. Remember,
                    to paste on a Mac, type ⌘ Command+V, and for any other kind of machine, type Control+V. Now if you
                    click on the words "its Wikipedia page," it should bring you right to the Wikipedia page of your
                    animal.


                    <img src="./image-11.png" style="width: 100vw;">
                <h2>Lists</h2>
                Even though you are linking your users to another page with more information about your animal, that
                doesn't mean you can't add any more information to your website. You can add elements such as lists
                about your favorite things about your animals. You can't find that information anywhere else on the
                internet!

                Let's make the first list about why you think your animal is awesome, but before we make the list, we
                should make a title for it. We don't want this title to be as large as the title for our website, and if
                you remember, the tag for the title of our website was "h1." That is the biggest heading, and the next
                biggest heading is "h2." As the numbers after the "h" get bigger, the size of the heading gets smaller,
                so we are going to want the title of our list to be "h2." It's not too big or too small, so add a new
                line after the paragraph with the Wikipedia link that we just finished. Then type the line below, and
                insert the name of your animal in the blank.

                <h2>______ are awesome because...</h2>
                You should now see your title appear under the paragraphs you wrote before. Now we need to add the list
                of awesome things about your animal. Before we add it, we first need to learn about the two types of
                lists, which are ordered and unordered lists. Ordered lists are made with numbers, and unordered lists
                are made with bullet points. The first example below is an ordered list because there are numbers
                ordering the items in the list. The second example below is an unordered list because nothing is
                ordering the items in the list.

                Ordered List
                <ol>
                    <li>First thing </li>
                    <li>Second thing </li>
                    <li>Third thing </li>
                </ol>



                Unordered List
                <ul>
                    <li>First thing </li>
                    <li>Second thing </li>
                    <li>Third thing </li>
                </ul>



                We're going to make one list of each type, and the first one we are going to make will be an ordered
                list. The tag for an ordered list is is <ol> because "o" and "l" are the first letters of Ordered List.
                    Let's put the opening and closing "ol" tags down underneath our title from the start to make sure we
                    don't forget later. Put a new line between the opening and closing "ol" tags.

                    <ol>

                    </ol>
                    Now we need to add our list items, which are the actual lines of text in our list. The tag for list
                    items is <li> for the same reason as <ol> (List Item). In the line between the "ol" tags, add your
                            list item using the "li" tag.

                            <ol>
                                <li>They can swim really well</li>
                            </ol>
                            After you write in the first thing you think is awesome about your animal, you should see it
                            appear on your website with a number 1. before it. You didn't have to write the 1. because
                            your web browser knows that this is an ordered list, which has numbers. To make our next
                            list items, highlight your first list item including the "li" tags, copy it (Control+C or ⌘
                            Command+C), add a new line under it, paste it (Control+V or ⌘ Command+V), and do that one
                            more time. You should now have three of the same list item listed as 1, 2, and 3. Now all
                            you have to do is change the text in between the "li" tags on the last two list items to two
                            other awesome things about your animal. When you are done, you should have an ordered list
                            with awesome things about your animal.

                            <img src="./image-12 (1).png" style="width: 100vw;">

                            Now we are going to add an unordered list, so we should first put a title in for this list.
                            Add a new line after our last list (after the
                        </ol>), and type the line below, filling in the name of your animal in the blank.

                        <h2>If I were a ______, I would...</h2>
                        Instead of typing out a whole new list, we can use the one we just made as a template for the
                        next list. Add a new line after the second title, and highlight the list we made before starting
                        and ending with the "ol" tags. Copy it (Control+C or ⌘ Command+C), and paste it (Control+V or ⌘
                        Command+V) in the new line under the second title. Now two of the same list should appear on
                        your website.

                        We want to change this list to be an unordered list instead of an ordered list, so the tag for
                        an unordered list is <ul> (Unordered List) instead of <ol>. Change the opening AND closing "ol"
                                tags to by "ul" tags. The "li" tags can stay the same, but change the information inside
                                the "li" tags to be things you would do if you were your animal. When you are done, you
                                should have an unordered list with bullet points.

                                <img src="./image-13 (1).png" style="width: 100vw;">

                                <h2>Video </h2>
                                The next element we are going to add is a video of your animal, so add a new line under
                                the unordered list you just made. We want a title for our video, but again, we don't
                                want the heading to be as big as the title of the website. Let's type an <h2> tag and
                                    then the title you want for your video. The simplest thing you can put is <h2>______
                                        Video</h2> where you fill in the name of your animal in the blank.

                                    Next, go to youtube.com, and search for a video of your animal. Once you've found
                                    the video you want to put on your website, click on the "Share" button right below
                                    the video on the right side. Then click "Embed" on the left side of the pop-up. The
                                    HTML code for the video should appear on the right side of the pop-up now. It is an
                                    "iframe" tag, which is the tag used to embed a video. Highlight everything from the
                                    opening "iframe" tag to the closing "iframe" tag, and copy it.



                                    Go back to Thimble, and paste the "iframe" tag you just copied right after the title
                                    of the video you made. Your video should now appear on your website, and you will be
                                    able to play it on the screen of your website.
